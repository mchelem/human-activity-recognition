Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set
==========================

This project creates a tidy data set using the data extracted from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

The data contains the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.


## Running the script

The code assumes the dataset was downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
and extracted to the directory "UCI HAR Dataset" inside the project's root directory.


In order to run it in a linux/MacOS environment you can issue:

```bash
./run_analysis.R
```
